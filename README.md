Back in 2009-2010, I got [Gambit Scheme](http://gambitscheme.org/) running in iOS and decided to build a game with it. The result was Farmaggedon, a stupid game where you blow up farm animals to avoid being hit by them.

I blogged about my progress working with Scheme on iOS back then and evidently a lot of people were inspired by it. Recently [another iOS game](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7361947) was featured on Hacker News that was written in Gambit Scheme, and it inspired me to dredge up the source of my game and completely open source it.

You're looking at the worst, messiest, most out-of-date code of all time. But it's also where I learned some of the most important concepts of my life.
